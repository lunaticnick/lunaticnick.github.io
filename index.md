## Welcome to Nikolaos GitHub Repository


**Who am I?**
I am an Engineer with a passion for technology, whether it is in the form of software or hardware.

I like fixing things or even better making things from scratch!!

**Why GitHub?**
Because it is the place to share your passion and get loads of input for how you can improve your software.
I am also studying to become a Web Developer and thus watch this space for my future projects.

**Where else can you find me?**
My personal web-page (which improving it will be my first project on completion of the Makers Academy bootcamp) is the following: www.sakellarios.net

So I hope you tag along in my journey of learning properly how to code and create cool projects.

Nikolaos
