## Welcome to Nikolaos GitHub Repository


**Who am I?**
I am an Engineer with a passion for technology, whether it is in the form of software or hardware.

Also I have recently graduated from [Makers Acedemy](http://www.makersacademy.com), so I can also claim the title of a Web Developer.


**Why GitHub?**
Because it is the place to share your passion and get loads of input for how you can improve your software.


**Where else can you find me?**
My personal web-page/ e-card site is the following: http://www.sakellarios.net

So I hope you tag along in my journey of learning properly how to code and create cool projects.

Nikolaos
